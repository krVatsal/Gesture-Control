#What is the task?
We are required to detect the bright area out of the picture provided

#Approach
1. We read the image
2. Apply gaussian blur on the image to reduce noise
3. Defined upper an dlower bounds of the color to be detected
4. Finally mask that area out and print the result

#Challenges
Noise in the image was the main challenge

#Solution 
Fixed using applying Gaussian blur
